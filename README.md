# Online Food Ordering App

## What I created?
An online food ordering app that uses Swiggy's live data and fetches you the restaurants and the menu served there. Made this web app from scratch without using create-react-app.

## What I learnt?
 Since the core of this web app is React, I learned all the deep concepts of React like:
* Components (writing components and reusing them)
* Basics like cdn, npm, CORS, parcel, babel, etc.
* Started this React App from basics/scratch from React elements.
* Props, states, and hooks.
* Config-driven UI, working with live data
* Behind-the-scenes ongoing stuff because of which is React is faster - Reconciliation algorithm
* Life Cycle of React
* Routing
* Lazy Loading
* Redux for state management
